## Content Pillar Rotation

Rotate through these 5 pillars consistently:

1. **Emotional discipline > venting**
2. **Structure > motivation**
3. **Sovereignty > dependency**
4. **AI as tool/partner, not authority**
5. **Daily practice > drama**

---

## Content Batch Creation

### Recommended Workflow:

**Week 0 (Planning Week):**
- Generate 12-15 X posts in batch (Host agent)
- Generate 6-8 Moltbook dialogues (Support agent)
- Generate 4 podcast outlines (Technical agent + Host + Support)

**Week 1-4 (Execution):**
- Schedule X posts from batch
- Post Moltbook dialogues live (fresher engagement)
- Record/publish podcast episodes weekly
