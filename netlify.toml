# Branch contexts: configure each Netlify site to build from a different branch
# and Netlify will use the matching context publish directory.
# Example: create a branch named `podcast` and point the podcast site to build
# from that branch. The `podcast` branch will publish the `podcast_mystical`
# folder while production (main) continues to publish `dashboard`.
