## Never Say (CTA Violations)

❌ "Buy now"
❌ "Limited time offer"
❌ "Join thousands of others"
❌ "Transform your life overnight"
❌ "This will fix everything"
❌ "You need this"

**Why?**
These violate calm authority, create urgency/scarcity, or remove sovereignty.

---

## Privacy + Sovereignty Messaging (Always Include)

**When mentioning the product:**
- "Conversations remain private within your AI account."
- "We do not access, read, or store your chats."
- "You stay sovereign."
- "The AI provides structured reflection support."
- "Your power. Your choice. Your reset."
